Notes:

Notes: 
- If you're using the REPO provided just add the service as described in the official HDP guidelines (https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.6.0.0/bk_ambari-operations/content/adding_a_service_to_your_hadoop_cluster.html)

If you are doing it on your own, just use the repository https://github.com/cas-bigdatalab/ambari-neo4j to append the new service


Do not hesitate in contact me if you have troubles with this  (ghp@gatv.ssr.upm.es)
